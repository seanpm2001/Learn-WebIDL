// About: 
// I decided to make WebIDL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-WebIDL) as WebIDL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the WebIDL programming language. It only makes sense to WebIDL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
